# Patisserie - Online Bakery System

This project presents an interactive Bakery Customization System prototype designed using Justinmind. The goal is to explore user interaction preferences when customizing cakesthrough two different prototypes â€“ one with minimal customization and another offering extensive options. This system simulates a real-world bakery ordering flow, providing a guided interface for users to select their preferred flavors, shapes, toppings, and more. The aim is to evaluate user experience and satisfaction with different levels of customization.

**Key Features-** 
- Two versions of the prototype to compare customization levels:
  - Basic Customization (Prototype A)
  - Advanced Customization (Prototype B)
- User interface flow simulates real bakery ordering experience.
- Organized navigation and feedback for each step of the customization process.
- Structured layout to test usability and user satisfaction.

**Tools Used-**

- Justinmind: Used to design and simulate the interactive prototypes with varying levels of customization.

**Additional Resources**
- R Script: Contains data analysis for user testing and satisfaction metrics.
- Screenshots: Illustrate the UI flow and customization stages for both prototypes.
